## FlipperHTTP Apps
### Issue: "WiFi Devboard is disconnected"
**Solutions:**
1. Check your WiFi settings in the app and re-save them.
2. Restart the app.
3. Exit the app, disconnect the board, reconnect it, and try using the app again.
4. If the above solutions donâ€™t resolve the issue:
   - Open the `UART Terminal` app.
     1. Click `Setup`.
     2. Change the `UART Pins` to `13,14`.
     3. Change the `Baudrate` to `115200`.
     4. Hit the `BACK` button.
   - Click `Open Port` and look for error messages like `wrong chip` or `load 0x400..`.
   - If such messages appear, the installed firmware is incompatible with your board. 
   - If you sure you installed the correct firmware then report the issue in the repository's `Issues` section. Make sure to include every step you followed (leave no details out).

### Issue: "Failed to receive data" in every app
**Solution:**
1. Update your WiFi credentials in the `Settings` menu option of the app. In the `FlipWiFi` app, this is done in the `Saved APs` option. Verify that you are connecting to a 2.4 GHz network. Supported boards do not support 5 GHz networks.
2. Save your WiFi manually in the `Saved APs` option of the `FlipWiFi` app.
   
### Issue: "Failed to scan..."" in the FlipWiFi app
**Solution:**
1. Delete FlipWiFi from your Flipper Zero and install FlipWiFi version 1.3.2 or higher. In the latest versions, if there aren't any 2.4 GHz networks around you, it will return an empty list instead.
2. Save your WiFi manually in the `Saved APs` option.
   
### Issue: "Failed to load received data from file" in the FlipWiFi app
**Solution:**
1. Delete FlipWiFi from your Flipper Zero and install FlipWiFi version 1.3.2 or higher.
2. Save your WiFi manually in the `Saved APs` option.

### Issue: My Flipper Zero freezes after opening the FlipWorld app
